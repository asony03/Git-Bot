## Problem Statement:

Github is one of the most popular source control and project management website in the world. However, there are some concerns not solved by Github out of the box such as:

* There is no way to automatically moderate user comments. In case of large open source projects, incidents of comment sections being misused for other form of communications have increased, which has led to more individual time being spent in moderating such repositories.

* Labels are very useful when it comes to managing and prioritzing tasks and issues on Github. In the case of large open source projects with hundreds of new issues pouring in daily, there is a need to identify the nature/severity of the issues and label/categorize them accordingly.
