# Practices:

**Development strategy:** Every feature should be developed and committed to a separate feature branch. The PRs should be approved by atleast 2 team members before merging the feature branch to master.

**Scurm masters rotation strategy:** 2 team members were acting as scrum masters per sprint on a rotational basis

**Don’t separate testing and development:** Blend of TDD and BDD to maintain a balance between testing and development.

**Task prioritization strategy - MoSCoW model:** MOSCOW statnds for Must haves, Should haves, Could haves and Won’t haves. Four main categories to break down our stories by priority.

## Tasks Rundown:

**Tasks completed before these 2 sprints:**

- Github Integration : Implement event listeners 

- Slack Integration

- API's for handling close/delete Issues and PRs

- Bot skeleton setup

- Github OAuth Integration

- Programatically generate github events for the repository

- DB Integration

- Generate mocking data

- Create mocking infrastructure / Unit Tests

- Selenium tests- create / comment on issue

- Selenium tests- create / comment on pull requests


**Sprint tasks:**

- Story(3) API for toxicity Detection 

- Story(3) End to end flow for users to add/delete repositories monitored by the bot

- Story(2) Update the Issue with the priority assigned from slack and update the slack message with a confirmation 

- Story(3) Add Event handlers for review comments.

- Story(2) Create additional APIs required to handle the end to end flow of adding/deleting repositories monitored by the bot 

- Story(2) Add integration with Slack - Post on slack if bug is detected and allow user to assign Priority from slack 

- Story(2) Delete toxic comment once user click on delete comment on slack and update the message with a confirmation

- Story(3) Manage and Update Scrum and project board

- Story(3) Add tests for new functionalities

- Story(5) Download issues data from Github archive and train the model

- Story(5) Deploying the bot on AWS

- Task(1) API for issue labelling


# Process:

## Standups/Syncups:

- Scrum meetups for every 3 days (4 meetups in total)
- Daily status updates via Slack channel
                  

## Sprint planning:

Most important step before we started working on the backlogs. we identified all the product backlog items for 2 sprints and discussed our initial plan for completing these product backlog items based on MOSCOW strategy.

**Spring planning outcomes:**
- *The sprint goal:* Summary of what we plan to accomplish in 2 weeks.
- *The sprint backlog:* The list of stories and other product backlog items the team has agreed to work on in 2 weeks.


## Sprint review:

The Sprint Review was equivalent to a user acceptance test where each team member demonstrates the results of the work they have done in the sprint. At the end of sprint 2 and before our demo with the TA, we thoroughly tested the end to end flow of our application.


## Sprint retrospective - A meeting to review the process and team working:

**What went well in 2 sprints (top 4 points):**

- Improved understanding of agile processes

- PR review process

- Coordination among team members facilitated by daily status updates

- Even distribution of workload


**What can be improved(top 2 points):**

- Backlog grooming needs to be improved

- Some stories were too big. We should have split them into smaller stories.
