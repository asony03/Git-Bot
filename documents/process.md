# Practices:

## Core and Corollary practices/strategies:

**Development strategy:** Every feature should be developed and committed to a separate feature branch. The PRs should be approved by atleast 1 member (2 for major changes) before merging the feature branch to master.

**Scurm masters rotation strategy:** 2 team members were acting as scrum masters per sprint on a rotational basis.

**Don’t separate testing and development:** Blend of TDD and BDD to maintain a balance between testing and development.

**Task prioritization strategy - MOSCOW model:** Stands for Must haves, Should haves, Could haves and Won’t haves. Four main categories to break down our stories by priority.

## Tasks Rundown:

**Tasks completed before these 2 sprints:**

- Github Integration : Implement event listeners 
- Slack Integration
- API's for handling close/delete Issues and PRs
- Bot skeleton setup
- Github OAuth Integration
- Programatically generate github events for the repository
- DB Integration
- Generate mocking data
- Create mocking infrastructure / Unit Tests
- Selenium tests- create / comment on issue
- Selenium tests- create / comment on pull requests

### Sprint tasks:

#### Amal
- Story(3) API for toxicity Detection 
- Story(3) Add tests for new functionalities

#### Siddu
- Story(3) End to end flow for users to add/delete repositories monitored by the bot
- Story(3) Create additional APIs required to handle the end to end flow of adding/deleting repositories monitored by the bot

#### Sharique
- Story(2) Update the Issue with the priority assigned from slack and update the slack message with a confirmation 
- Story(2) Add integration with Slack - Post on slack if bug is detected and allow user to assign Priority from slack 
- Story(2) Delete toxic comment once user click on delete comment on slack and update the message with a confirmation

#### Harsh
- Story(5) Download issues data from Github archive and train the model
- Task(1) API for issue labelling


# Process:

## Standups/Syncups:

- Scrum meetups for every 3 days (4 meetups in total)
- Daily status updates via Slack channel
- 3 story points to be done by each member in each sprint
                  

## Sprint Planning:

Most important step before we started working on the backlogs. we identified all the product backlog items for 2 sprints and discussed our initial plan for completing these product backlog items based on MOSCOW strategy

**Spring planning outcomes:**
- *The sprint goal:* Summary of what we plan to accomplish in 2 weeks
- *The sprint backlog:* The list of stories and other product backlog items the team has agreed to work on in 2 weeks


## Sprint Review:

The Sprint Review was equivalent to a user acceptance test where each team member demonstrates the results of the work they have done in the sprint. At the end of sprint 2 and before our demo with the TA, we thoroughly tested the end to end flow of our application


## Sprint Retrospective - A meeting to review the process and team working:

**What went well in 2 sprints (top 4 points):**

- Improved understanding of agile processes
- PR review process
- Coordination among team members facilitated by daily status updates
- Even distribution of workload

**What can be improved(top 2 points):**

- Backlog grooming needs to be improved
- Some stories were too big. We should have split them into smaller stories.
